# developers.whatwg.org

This repository contains scripts that will generate a pristine copy of [developers.whatwg.org](developers.whatwg.org). It uses a collection of arcane python scripts supplied by the W3C, and my own Ruby scripts that remove cruft.

To build your own copy, checkout this repostory, you'll need:

* Ruby (any version)
* Python (2.4+)
* Subversion
* LibXML2

To install dependencies: 

```bash
bundle install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `make clean` then `make` to produce the required contents (final output is written to the `public` directory)
The contents of `public` are exactly what I have deployed to developers.whatwg.org.

If you're hoping to contribute to spec content, you'll need to talk to [Hixie](http://twitter.com/Hixie), as for styling and display of this content, I'm your manâ€¦ and this is the repo.

## Want to get involved?
