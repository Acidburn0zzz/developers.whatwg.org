  <h1>About this specification</h1>

  <p>This HTML5 specification is like no other—It has been processed with <em>you</em>, the humble web developer in mind.</p>

	<p>We've focused on readability and ease of access. Unlike the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">full HTML specification</a>, this "web developer edition" removes information that only browser vendors need know.</p>

	<p>This edition is written by <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/">Ian Hickson</a>, everything style and presentational, by <a href="http://germanforblack.com">Ben Schwarz</a> and is a derivative of work that was conducted by Ben,  <a href="http://aestheticallyloyal.com">Anthony Kolber</a> (Together, forming <a href="http://ab-c.com.au">ab+c</a>) and  <a href="http://people.w3.org/mike/">Mike™ Smith</a>, <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C.</a> <br> Read about <a href="http://www.germanforblack.com/articles/moving-towards-readable-w3c-specs">how it all started.</a></p>
