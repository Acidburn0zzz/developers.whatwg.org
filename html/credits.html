  <h1>About this specification</h1>

  <p>This HTML5 specification is like no other—It has been processed with <em>you</em>, the humble web developer in mind.</p>

	<p>The focus of this specification is readability and ease of access. Unlike the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">full HTML specification</a>, this "web developer edition" removes information that only browser vendors need know.</p>

	<p>To read about its conception, construction and future, <a href="http://germanforblack.com/articles/html5-for-web-developers" rel="external">read the press release.</a></p>
